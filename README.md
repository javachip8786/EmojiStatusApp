# EmojiStatusApp
In this APP, user can login using Google sign authentication, after doing this he can update his status using Cloud firebase. I have added some filters so that user can only emoji to update their status.
i have used Recycler view which is very efficient to show components on the main page in a scrollable manner.
In data structures i have used MAP to store Emoji format and checking for each charatcer wise updating so that we enter a valid emoji each time.
